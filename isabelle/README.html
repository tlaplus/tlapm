<h2>TLA+: Lamport's Temporal Logic of Actions specification language</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Leslie_Lamport/tla/tla.html">TLA</a>
is a linear-time temporal logic introduced by Leslie Lamport in
<em>The Temporal Logic of Actions</em> (ACM TOPLAS 16(3), 1994,
872-923). Unlike other temporal logics, both systems and properties
are represented as logical formulas, and logical connectives such as
implication, conjunction, and existential quantification represent
structural relations such as refinement, parallel composition, and
hiding.</p>

<p>TLA+ is a language for specifying and verifying concurrent and distributed systems. It is based on a variant of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory for describing the data structures manipulated by the algorithms to be verified, and on TLA for describing their dynamic behavior. TLA+ has been applied to numerous case studies.
</p>

<p>This directory formalizes TLA+ in Isabelle (version 2009-1), as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
  <em>PredicateLogic</em> theory
  defines classical first-order logic as a basis for an encoding
  of TLA+. TLA+ is untyped, to the extent that it does not
  even distinguish between terms and formulas. We therefore
  declare a single type <em>c</em> that represents the universe of
  "constants" rather than introducing the traditional types <em>i</em> and
  <em>o</em> of first-order logic that, for example, underly Isabelle/ZF.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>SetTheory</em> defines the basic syntax and axiomatization of
  set theory.
  </li>

  <li>
  The <em>FixedPoints</em> theory develops the
  Knaster-Tarski theorems for least and greatest fixed points in the
  subset lattice. This development is used for the construction of
  natural numbers; it also serves as a test for the encoding of TLA+
  set theory.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>Functions</em> theory: functions in TLA+ are not defined
  (e.g., as sets of pairs),
  but axiomatized, and in fact, pairs and tuples are later defined as special
  functions. Incidentally, this approach helps us to identify functional
  values, and to automate the reasoning about them. This theory considers
  only unary functions; functions with multiple arguments are defined
  as functions over products.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>Peano</em> theory: Peano's axioms for natural numbers. We prove
  the existence of a structure satisfying these axioms and derive the
  set of natural numbers.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>NatOrderings</em> theory: introduces the order &lt;= over
  natural numbers. It also defines <em>a &lt; b</em> (for arbitrary
  values) as <em>a &lt;= b &amp; a # b</em>. Proves many lemmas over
  these orders. Also defines intervals <em>m .. n</em> for natural
  numbers <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>.
  </li>

  <li>
  The <em>Tuples</em> theory defines tuples and relations in TLA+.
  Tuples are functions whose domains are intervals of the form
  <em>1 .. n</em>, for some natural number <em>n</em>, and relations are
  sets of tuples. This theory also introduces the notation <em>[x : S,
  y : T]</em> to denote the set of functions <em>f</em> with domain
  <em>{x,y}</em> such that <em>f[x] \in S</em> and <em>f[y] \in T</em>.

  <p>
  
  Finally, this theory introduces standard notions for binary
  relations, such as orderings, equivalence relations and so on.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>CaseExpressions</em> theory: reasoning about CASE expressions in
  TLA+.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>Strings</em> theory: encoding of characters and strings (written
  with two single quotes: ''string''). Characters are represented as
  pairs of hexadecimal numbers, strings are sequences of characters.

  <p>

  Records should be written as finite functions, e.g. <em>(''foo''
  :&gt; 1) @@ (''bar'' :&gt; TRUE)</em>, and sets of records can be
  written using the notation for sets of finite functions introduced
  in theory <em>Tuples</em>.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>NatArith</em> theory: addition, subtraction, and multiplication
  over natural numbers. The subtraction (noted <em>--</em>) is defined
  such that the result is cut off at 0: this is different from
  the standard difference over integers.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>NatDivision</em> theory: divisibility relation, division and
  modulus for natural numbers.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>

The theories are accompanied by two examples:

<ul>
  <li>
  <em>Allocator</em>:
  a case study for the specification and analysis of reactive systems
  in TLA+ . This theory contains some elementary invariant proofs over
  a specification that uses basic set theory.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>AtomicBakeryG</em>:
  proof of type correctness and mutual exclusion for
  the well-known Bakery algorithm for <em>N</em> processes.
  </li>
</ul>
