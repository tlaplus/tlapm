subsection \<open> Syntax and axioms for functions \<close>

text \<open>
  Functions in \tlaplus{} are not defined (e.g., as sets of pairs),
  but axiomatized, and in fact, pairs and tuples will be defined as special
  functions. Incidentally, this approach helps us to identify functional
  values, and to automate the reasoning about them. This theory considers
  only unary functions; functions with multiple arguments are defined
  as functions over products. We follow the development of functions given
  in Section 16.1 of ``Specifying Systems''.
