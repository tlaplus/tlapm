The menu structure is given at the beginning of file assets/header.js
It must be reflected in the directory structure of content/

It cannot be more than 3 levels deep (content/, its subdirectories, and
its subsubdirectories).

The directory names are the same as the corresponding menu names,
where every character is replaced by _, except for letters,
digits, plus (+) and dash (-).

There may be extra files and directories, they will be reachable by
their direct URL, but not linked in the menus.  The menus will not
work correctly in such files.

All the HTML files must use the boilerplate given in
content/template.html.  Except of course files that don't want
to display the menus.  Currently, only some redirection files
(for example content/Community/TLA+_net.html) are not using the menu.

The actual contents of the files is just HTML.  It may use the site's
CSS elements (the <div> stuff), but that is not mandatory.
