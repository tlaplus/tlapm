## The 'release' job creates an empty Github (draft) release before the 'publish' job
## below builds and uploads installers into the release.  This complexity is required
## because the standard Github release action cannot be executed as part of the matrix
## job (the first runner to create the release wins but the others fail).  In other words,
## we need a single runner to create the release to which all runners will upload their
## assets (installers).  Things would be simpler if e.g. Linux could build the installers
## for all platforms.
