 * The action frontend is responsible on transforming obligations containing
 * actions to purely first-order obligations
 * 1) expend definitions of UNCHANGED, [A]_v and <<A>>_v
 * 2) distribute primes over constant operators
 * 3) for a leibniz non-constant operator op, distribute primes over hash(op) (we
 * treat all non-constant operators right now, see comment below)
 * 4) primed atoms: constant atoms -> a, else -> hash(a)
 * 5) coalesce all non-leibniz operators and primed non-leibniz operators
 * (postponed, see comment below).
 *
 * comment:
 * this will be done only after we integrate the SANY parser to TLAPM as we dont
 * have the leibnizicy information right now in TLAPM.
