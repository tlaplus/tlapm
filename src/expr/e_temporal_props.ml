(* we should generate box-level here using a expr-visitor and replacing
 * facts (with the known cost of duplicating the context for each
 * sequent. The steps are as follows:
   * 1) if it already has a level (i.e. theorem and axioms get a box level
   * without regard to the sequent in the fact) then we do nothing
   * 2) if the fact is a formula, then we apply Leslieâ€™s algorithm to
   * decide its level.
   * 3) if the fact is a sequent, if all (visible) assumptions are
   * box-level, then the fact is box-level.
