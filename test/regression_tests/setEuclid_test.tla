Here is the PlusCal algorithm, which as you can see appears inside a comment.
The `variables' statement declares S to be a variable with initial value
Input, and declares gcd to be a variable that will be given some
default initial value.  The algorithm sets gcd to be the GCD of Input when
it terminates.

--algorithm EuclidForSets {
    variables S = Input, gcd ;
    { lbl: while (Cardinality(S) > 1)
             { with (i \in S, j \in {s \in S : s > i})
                 {  S := (S \ {j}) \cup {j-i}
                 }
             } ;
           gcd := CHOOSE t \in S : TRUE
    }
}

In PlusCal, an execution step (an atomic action) consists of execution
from one lable to the next.  There is an implicit label Done at the end
of the algorithm.  Thus, each iteration of the while loop is one step,
and there is one final step that sets gcd.

The translator put TLA+ translation of this algorithm below, between the
BEGIN and END comments.  The translation adds a variable pc whose value
indicates the where in the algorithm the locus of control is.

The important parts of the specification are the initial predicate Init,
which specifies the initial state, and the next-state relation Next,
which describes how the state can change--unprimed variables referring
to their value in the old state and primed variables referring to their
value in the new state.  The second disjunction of Next allows steps that
leave the state unchanged when the algorithm has reached its terminating
state.  You can ignore that disjunction and those steps, which don't
affect invariance properties.
