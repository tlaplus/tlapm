---- MODULE sndord_test ----

EXTENDS TLAPS

(** Usable theorems quantify on fst-order operators.  This may become a problem
    for encodings into a fst-order logic like SMT-LIB.  This test exploits a
    flaw in the current SMT encoding that relies on the treatment of fst-order
    and snd-order operators.
