(****************************************************************************
We now give the algorithm.  The basic idea is that the set Acceptor of
real acceptors emulate an execution of the PCon algorithm with
Acceptor as its set of acceptors.  Of course, they must do that
without knowing which of the other processes in ByzAcceptor are real
acceptors and which are fake acceptors.  In addition, they don't know
whether a leader is behaving according to the PCon algorithm or if it
is malicious.

The main idea of the algorithm is that, before performing an action of
the PCon algorithm, a good acceptor determines that this action is
actually enabled in that algorithm.  Since an action is enabled by the
receipt of one or more messages, the acceptor has to determine that
the enabling messages are legal PCon messages.  Because algorithm PCon
allows a 1a message to be sent at any time, the only acceptor action
whose enabling messages must be checked is the Phase2b action.  It is
enabled iff the appropriate 1c message and 2a message are legal.  The
1c message is legal iff the leader has received the necessary 1b
messages.  The acceptor therefore maintains a set of 1b messages that
it knows have been sent, and checks that those 1b messages enable the
sending of the 1c message.

A 2a message is legal in the PCon algorithm iff (i) the corresponding
1c message is legal and (ii) it is the only 2a message that the leader
sends.  In the BPCon algorithm, there are no explicit 2a messages.
They are implicitly sent by the acceptors when they send enough 2av
messages.

We leave unspecified how an acceptor discovers what 1b messages have
been sent.  In the Castro-Liskov algorithm, this is done by having
acceptors relay messages sent by other acceptors.  An acceptor knows
that a 1b message has been sent if it receives it directly or else
receives a copy from a weak Byzantine quorum of acceptors.  A
(non-malicious) leader must determine what 1b messages acceptors know
about so it chooses a value so that a quorum of acceptors will act on
its Phase1c message and cause that value to be chosen.  However, this
is necessary only for liveness, so we ignore this for now.

In other implementations of our algorithm, the leader sends along with
the 1c message a proof that the necessary 1b messages have been sent.
The easiest way to do this is to have acceptors digitally sign their 1b
messages, so a copy of the message proves that it has been sent (by the
acceptor indicated in the message's acc field).  The necessary proofs
can also be constructed using only message authenticators (like the
ones used in the Castro-Liskov algorithm); how this is done is
described elsewhere.

In the abstract algorithm presented here, which we call
BPCon, we do not specify how acceptors learn what 1b
messages have been sent.  We simply introduce a variable knowsSent such
that knowsSent[a] represents the set of 1b messages that (good)
acceptor a knows have been sent, and have an action that
nondeterministically adds sent 1b messages to this set.
