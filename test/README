1. How to launch the tests

Before you can launch the tests, the PM must be installed into this
directory (the "test" directory). This is accomplished by launching
the installer with the -d option:

   ../tools/installer/tlaps-1.4.5-*-inst.exe -d `pwd`



2. Format of the test files.

Every file in this directory (and recursively in its subdirectories)
with a name that ends in "_test.tla" defines one test of the test
suite.

The file must be a syntactically valid TLA+ module.  After the last
line of ==== are the commands for the test harness:

- command: <com>
  Executes the command.  Several of these may be specified, in
  which case, they are all executed, but only the last one is checked
  with the "results" clause.  The standard outputs and standard error
  outputs of the commands are all concatenated in execution order.
  If this clause is omitted, the default command is executed:
    ${TLAPM} --toolbox 0 0 --nofp ${FILE} --stretch ${STRETCH}

- stretch: <n>
  Changes the STRETCH parameter to <n>. This should only be used for
  testing obligations that must fail.

- result: <n>
  Checks that the result code of the command is <n>.  If there is
  no "results" clause, the defaut "result: 0" is checked.

- stdout: <regexp>
  Checks the presence of <regexp> in the standard output of the
  command(s).  Several of these may be specified.  In this case, they
  check that the strings are all present in the same order, in
  different lines of the output.

- nostdout: <regexp>
  Check the absence of <regexp> anywhere in the standard output.
  Several of these may be specified, they must all be absent.
  Note: if an obligation is submitted to several provers, only the
  record corresponding to the latest one is checked for nostdout strings.
  This means that "nostdout: failed" will actually check for an obligation
  that was not proved by any prover.

- stderr: <regexp>
  Same as "stdout", but for standard error output.  Note that the
  toolbox messages of the PM are on stderr.

- nostderr: <regexp>
  Same as "nostdout", but for standard error output.

- nostd*: <regexp>
  Does the same checks as two clauses, one "nostdout" and one
  "nostderr", each with the <regexp> as argument.

- check: <command>
  Run an arbitrary command and check that its return status is 0.
  This command can read the files ${FILE}.stdout and ${FILE}.stderr
  to get the standard output and standard error output of the
  command(s) launched by the test harness.

- \*<anything>
  A line beginning with \* (possibly preceded by spaces) is ignored.

NOTE: the space after the colon is mandatory.  Your commands will
not be recognized if it is missing.


Default checks:

- If there is no "result" clause, the following clause is evaluated:
    result: 0

- If none of the stdout, nostdout, stderr, nostderr, nostd*, and check
  clauses are present, the following clauses are evaluated:
    nostd*: ending abnormally
    nostd*: status:failed


The shell variable ${TLAPM} is defined to be ".../tlapm -I .../src",
which launches the local PM with access to the local TLAPS.tla.  Use
this variable in your "command" clauses instead of invoking the
installed version of the PM.
